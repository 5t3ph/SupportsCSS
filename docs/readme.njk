# SupportsCSS

> Live, in-browser detection of modern CSS support for selectors, features, and at-rules. Applies support-based classes, exposes a results object, and allows custom tests.

Inspired by the legacy of [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/), this script evaluates a user's browser for cutting-edge modern CSS support beyond the capabilities of `@supports`.

- Classes are added to `<html>` as either `supports-[feature]` or `no-[feature]`, allowing easier progressive enhancement and build strategies
- Checks for selectors like `:has()`, properties like `text-box-trim`, features like relative color syntax, and at-rules like `@layer` - [see full test suite](#test-suite)
- Allows adding custom tests
- Exposes a results object to iterate over detected support, as well as individual results for quick conditional checks in JS

> SupportsCSS is _not_ a polyfill, it is only feature detection. Continue using tools like [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) or [LightningCSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) for prefixing and other features like syntax lowering. SupportsCSS is a layer on top of those tools.

## Installation & Usage

Review the full docs at [SupportsCSS.dev](https://supportscss.dev).

## Test Suite

{{ supportTable | safe }}

### How were these features selected?

Features were selected based on:

- `@supports` limitations
- instability of the spec
- freshness to the language
- impact on CSS architecture
- impact on progressive enhancement
